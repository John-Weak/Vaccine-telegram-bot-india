## Why was it created?
Because I needed vaccination and government was not kind enough to specify the time around which the public could book their slot to get the dose.
(ofcourse the slot booking start time was random and filled completely in seconds).

## Why not use the code that was written by someone else but did the same thing?
Where is the fun in that? Also it lead to an intersting finding that the API used on phone and desktop was different,phone API had more updated data while desktop API supplied older data. 

## Tech
